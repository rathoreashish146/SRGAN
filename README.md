# Research Paper Abstract
The research paper introduces a state-of-the-art approach to single image super-resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The proposed model leverages the power of deep learning to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs while preserving fine details and producing visually realistic results. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the network architecture, loss functions, and training strategies employed to achieve remarkable advancements in the field of image super-resolution.

# Project Structure
The implementation is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. Ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in this directory before running the code.

models: Here, you will find the implementation of the generator and discriminator networks as described in the research paper. The models are implemented using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and include pre-trained weights for ease of use.

utils: This directory includes utility functions and scripts required for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The code is designed to be modular, allowing easy customization for different use cases.

# notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step guidance on using the codebase. These notebooks include detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to facilitate understanding and experimentation.

# results: After training the model, the generated high-resolution images and evaluation metrics will be saved in this directory for further analysis.

Getting Started
